# Share on Mastodon
Automatically share WordPress posts on [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/).

Share on Mastodon is compatible with both the Classic and the Block Editor (Gutenberg). It supports mobile apps, too, on the condition that _either_ the "Share Always" setting is enabled _or_ a filter (in PHP) is in place that accomplishes the same.

## Documentation
Complete documentation, and code examples, can be found at https://jan.boddez.net/wordpress/share-on-mastodon.
