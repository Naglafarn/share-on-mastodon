# Share on Mastodon
Automatically share WordPress posts on [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/).

Supports image uploads (and alt text), custom formatting, and so on.

Share on Mastodon is compatible with the classic as well as the block editor ("Gutenberg").

## (Mobile) Apps
Share on Mastodon supports 3rd-party apps, too, on the condition that the "Share Always" setting is enabled. (And, for more fine-grained control, there's [a filter hook](https://jan.boddez.net/wordpress/share-on-mastodon#share_on_mastodon_enabled).)

### Micropub
Share on Mastodon can also be added as a Micropub syndication target, allowing you to enable (or disable) sharing right from your _Micropub client_. (You'll want to _disable_ "Share Always" for this.)
