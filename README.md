# Share on Mastodon
Automatically share WordPress posts on [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/). Supports image uploads (and alt text), custom formatting, and so on.

Compatible with the classic as well as the block editor ("Gutenberg").

## Compatibility With Mobile WordPress Apps
Share on Mastodon supports 3rd-party WordPress apps, too, on the condition that the "Share Always" setting is enabled. (And, for more fine-grained control, there's [a filter hook](https://jan.boddez.net/wordpress/share-on-mastodon#share_on_mastodon_enabled).)

### Micropub
Share on Mastodon can also be added as a Micropub syndication target, allowing you to enable (or disable) sharing right from your _Micropub client_. (You'll want to _disable_ "Share Always" for this.)

## Installation
Simply download the plugin from https://wordpress.org/plugins/share-on-mastodon/ or install from within your WordPress' admin interface.

## Documentation
Complete documentation as well as example code for extending Share on Mastodon can be found at https://jan.boddez.net/wordpress/share-on-mastodon.
