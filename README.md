# Share on Mastodon
Automatically share WordPress posts on [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/).

Custom formatting is done through filter hooks rather than the options page UI, and requires some familiarity with PHP. (Always here to help, though!) Benefits are things like infinite flexibility, _version control_, and, frankly, less code for me to maintain.

Share on Mastodon is compatible with both the Classic and the Block Editor (Gutenberg). It supports mobile apps, too, on the condition that _either_ the "Share Always" setting is enabled _or_ a [so-called filter callback](https://jan.boddez.net/wordpress/share-on-mastodon#share_on_mastodon_enabled)—literally, a single line of PHP!—is in place.
