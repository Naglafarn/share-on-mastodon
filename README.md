# Share on Mastodon
Automatically share WordPress posts on [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/).

Advanced formatting is done through filter hooks rather than the options page UI, and requires some familiarity with PHP. (Always here to help, though!)

Share on Mastodon is compatible with both the Classic and the Block Editor (Gutenberg). It supports mobile apps, too, on the condition that _either_ the "Share Always" setting is enabled.
