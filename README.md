# Share on Mastodon
Automatically share WordPress posts on [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/).

Advanced formatting is done through filter hooks rather than the options page UI, and requires some familiarity with PHP. (Always here to help, though!)

Share on Mastodon is compatible with both the Classic and the Block Editor (Gutenberg).

It supports mobile apps, too, on the condition that the "Share Always" setting is enabled. (And, for more fine-grained control, there's [a filter hook](https://jan.boddez.net/wordpress/share-on-mastodon#share_on_mastodon_enabled).)

## Micropub
Share on Mastodon can also be added as a Micropub syndication target, allowing you to enable, or disable, sharing right from your _Micropub client_. (You'll want to _disable_ "Share Always" for this.)
